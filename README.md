# cost.

This project is a CRUD web application built using Next.js 13 and json-server. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete projects and their associated services. The data is stored in a JSON data file, and the CRUD operations are performed using HTTP requests to the json-server API. This project is intended for use as a prototype or for testing purposes, and it is not intended for production use.

⚠️ This project is not responsive because it was created for learning purposes (it was created on a 1920 x 1080 screen).
### Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (React framework)
- [React Query v4](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) (TanStack Query)
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (tool for creating a fake REST API, which can be used for prototyping and testing. It allows you to quickly create a data store using JSON data, and then perform the CRUD operations on that data using HTTP requests.)
